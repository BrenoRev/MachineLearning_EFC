## Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and materials for a practical deep learning course focused on image recognition using machine learning. The course is based on the content-based language instruction method, which means that you will learn English as you learn about something relevant.

Course Description
The course focuses on practical deep learning for image recognition, with a strong emphasis on hands-on learning. The course is designed to teach you the skills you need to build deep learning models that can recognize objects and patterns in images.

Learning Sources
The course is based on the Fast.ai course, which is a popular resource for learning deep learning. You will be learning from sources in English, which will help you to improve your English skills while you learn about deep learning.

The main course website contains all the materials you need to get started, including videos, notebooks, and assignments. The videos provide detailed explanations of the concepts covered in the course, while the notebooks give you hands-on experience working with the code.

The course also includes a freely available book, which is available on Github. This book provides additional background information on deep learning and image recognition, as well as practical tips and advice for building your own deep learning models.
